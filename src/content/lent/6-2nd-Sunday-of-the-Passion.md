## Blessing of Palms and Procession

[Download (Liber Usualis p. 579-591)](/pdf/palm-sunday-blessing-and-procession.pdf)

### **Blessing of Palms**

When everything is ready, the celebrant and the sacred ministers [or servers] genuflect or bow to the altar as usual, and go behind the table, facing the people.

**We are signing:** _Hosánna fílio Dávid_ (p. 580). Tone: E.

### **Distribution of Palms**

When the celebrant begins distribution of the palms. If these chants are not long enough, they are repeated until the distribution of palms is finished; if, on the other hand, the distribution ends first, the _Glória Pátri_ is sung at once, followed by the antiphon.

**We are signing:** _Pueri Hebraeórum_ (p. 581-583) Tone: E (also psalm).

### **The reading of Gospel**

p. 583

### **Procession with Palms**

1. _Láuda, Jerúsalem_ (p. 588)
2. _Glória, laus_ (p. 586) 
3. _Ingrediénte_ (p. 590)

During the procession we sing _Láuda, Jerúsalem_. After reaching the main entrance of the church, we sing _Glória, laus_ in the following manner: the two cantors are taking place behind the closed main entrance of the church and signing the verses _alone_ while the _Glória, laus_ is sung by the whole congregation. At the end of the _Glória, laus_ hymn, the celebrant is knocking the door three times with the cross, the door are then opened, the choir installs itself in the usual place and sings the responsory _Ingrediénte_. After the responsory, the celebrant says _Dóminus vobíscum_ followed by the prayer. After the prayer he changes the red vestments for purple, and the Mass begins.
