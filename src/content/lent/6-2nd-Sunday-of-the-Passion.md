| <p class='no-break no-margin'>[Pueri Hebraeórum](/pdf/palm-sunday-blessing-and-procession.pdf)</p> | 581-583 | When the celebrant begins distribution of the palms. If these chants are not long enough, they are repeated until the distribution of palms is finished; if, on the other hand, the distribution ends first, the _Glória Pátri_ is sung at once, followed by the antiphon. |

At the end of the _Glória, laus_ hymn, the celebrant is knocking the door three times with the cross, the door are then opened, the choir installs itself in the usual place and sings the responsory _Ingrediénte_. After the responsory, the celebrant says _Dóminus vobíscum_ followed by the prayer. After the prayer he changes the red vestments for purple, and the Mass begins. |
