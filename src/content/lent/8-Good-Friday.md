## The Solemn Afternoon Liturgy

*Until the Holy Cross is unveiled, neither clergy nor servers genuflect to the altar, but only bow their heads. But when the Cross has been unveiled until the beginning of the Easter Vigil <u>exclusive</u>, all genuflect before the Cross on the principal altar.*

## The third part of the Liturgy: The Adoration Of The Holy Cross

After the solemn collects, the solemn adoration of the Cross begins.

The holy Cross is unveiled in the following way:

The celebrant, holding the Cross, with deacon and subdeacon \[first and second servers\] on either side, and two acolytes \[servers\] with lighted candles, goes to the Epistle side on floor-level, stands facing the people, and uncovers the top of the cross a little. An acolyte \[server\] holds the book; the celebrant intones alone, at a low pitch, [Ecce lignum Crúcis](/pdf/ecce-lignum.pdf), and the sacred ministers sing it with him as far as _Veníte, adorémus_, which is sung by the schola and all the people, standing.

The adoration of the Cross then begins as follows: first the celebrant comes alone, then the sacred ministers, then the clergy and lastly the servers. If it can be done conveniently, they all take their shoes off, and they approach the Cross one after the other: after a simple genuflexion made three times, they kiss the feet of the crucifix.

When the celebrant, ministers, clergy and servers have completed their adoration of the Cross, it is carried to the communion-rail by the two acolytes \[or two servers\] accompanied by the two other acolytes with lighted candles. It is held there in the same way as indicated above so that the faithful can come past the Cross as it were in procession, the men first and then the women. They devoutly kiss the feet of the crucifix after making a simple genuflexion.


While the adoration of the Cross is taking place, the schola (divided into two choirs) sings the [Reproaches](/pdf/good-friday-reproaches.pdf) and other chants.

The singing is continued for as long as the adoration continues. It always ends with the doxology _Sempitérna sit beátae Trinitáti glória_ from the hymn _Pánge, lingua, gloriósi lauream certaminis_ (p. 745).

## The fourth part of the Liturgy: Holy Communion

When the Blessed Sacrament is brought back to the high altar, we sing the antiphons (p. 746, 747, [download](/pdf/good-friday-part-4.pdf)).

After that, all present: clergy, servers and people, standing, recite _Pater noster_ in Latin with the celebrant, gravely and distinctly; and all add _Amen_ at the end.

After the communion, the celebrant purifies his fingers and dries them, saying nothing. He then replaces the ciborium in the tabernacle. Then the celebrant stands in the middle of the altar with the book in front of him and the sacred ministers on either side of him, and with his hands joined, he sings the three collects. All stand and answer: _Amen_.

The celebrant and the sacred ministers go down the altar steps, genuflect, and return to the sacristy with the acolytes \[or servers\].
