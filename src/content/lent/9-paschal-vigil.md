\[[Download](/pdf/paschal-vigil-part-1.pdf)\]

After Lesson II we sing _Cantémus Dómino_ (p. 776R). After Lesson III _Vinea_ (p. 776S), and after Lesson IV _Atténde_ (p. 776U).

After the last Canticle, the first part of the litany follows.

## The First Part Of The Litany

\[[Download](/pdf/paschal-vigil-litany-1.pdf)\]

When the Collect after the fourth Lesson is finished, all kneel. The Litany of the Saints is sung **without doubling the invocations**, <u>until _Propítius esto_ exclusive</u>.

The Litany is sung by two cantors kneeling in the middle of the sanctuary; the celebrant kneeling in his place. If there are no cantors, it is sung or said by the celebrant himself, kneeling with the servers on the lowest step of the altar towards the Epistle side.

Meanwhile a vessel of baptismal water to be blessed, with everything else needed for the blessing, is prepared in the sanctuary, on the Epistle side, where the people can see it.

## The Blessing Of Water For Baptism

When the Blessing (and Baptism) is finished, the baptismal water is carried to the font, in procession.

We sing _Sicut cérvus_ (p. 776BB, [download](/pdf/paschal-vigil-sicut-cervus.pdf)).

The renewal of the promises of baptism follows.

## The Second Part Of The Litany

\[[Download](/pdf/paschal-vigil-litany-2.pdf)\]

After the Renewal of baptismal promises, if there are cantors or other clerics to sing the Litany, the celebrant and ministers \[servers\] make reverence to the altar and return to the sacristy.

If there are no cantors or clerics, the celebrant kneels on the lowest step of the altar, towards the Epistle side, and completes the singing or recitation of the Litany from _Propítius esto_, the people answering. **The invocations are not doubled.** When the Litany is ended, the celebrant and ministers go to the sacristy.

## The Mass Of The Paschal Vigil

[Mass I](/pdf/i.pdf), [Propria](/pdf/paschal-vigil-mass.pdf)

At the end of the Litany the cantors solemnly intone _Kýrie, eléison_ (p. 16); the celebrant with the ministers \[servers\] goes to the altar.

When the choir has finished _Kýrie, eléison_, he intones _Glória in excélsis_; the church bells are rung and the organ plays; where it is the custom, bells are rung within the church; statues and pictures are uncovered.

After _Allelúia_ (repeated three times, each time at a higher pitch), we sing immediately _Confitémini Dómino_ (p. 776II).

The Credo **is not said**, but when the Gospel is finished, the celebrant sings _Dóminus vobíscum_, then: _Orémus_. **There is no Offertory Antiphon**. At the _Lavábo_, _Glória Patri_ is said.

### At the Canon

_Pax Dómini_ is said, but **not Agnus Dei**; the kiss of peace is not given. The Prayer _Dómine Jesu Christe, qui dixísti_, is omitted, but the other prayers _Dómine Jesu Christe, Fili Dei vivi_, and _Percéptio Córporis tui_, are said as usual.

After the Holy Communion is distributed, the _Lauds of Easter Sunday_ are sung (p. 776KK). They start with _Allelúia_, followed by _Laudáte_, and finish with the antiphon _Allelúia_ repeated.

> _Allelúia_, _Laudáte_, _Allelúia_ is sung by the schola.

Then, at once, **the celebrant** intones the _Benedictus antiphon_: _Et valde mane_ (p. 776KK).

The _Benedictus_ is then sung with _Glória Pátri_ at the end, and the altar is censed as usual. The antiphon _Et valde mane_ (p. 776LL) is repeated.

Then, the celebrant sings _Dóminus Vobiscum_ and says the prayer. Then he sings _Dóminus Vobiscum_ again and sings _Ite míssa est_. The chorus and the people answer _Déo grátias_ (p. 776MM).

The celebrant gives the blessing in the usual way. The Last Gospel **is omitted**, and all return to the sacristy.
