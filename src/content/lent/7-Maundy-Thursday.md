## From the beginning of the Mass to the Gospel

[Mass IV](/pdf/iv.pdf) (??)

1. **Intr:** _Nos autem_ (p. 667)
   
   > After censing the altar the celebrant reads the _Introit_ and _Kýrie, eléison_ and intones the _Glória in excélsis_. The bells are rung and the organ is played, **but from now onwards they are silent until the _Glória in excélsis_ of the Mass of the Easter Vigil**.
2. **Grad:** _Christus fáctus est_ (p. 669)

**No Credo today.**

## The Washing of the Feet

\[[Download](/pdf/maundy-thursday-part-2.pdf)\]

The celebrant, having made reverence to the altar, goes to the bench and sits. The deacon and subdeacon [or the two principal servers] bring the twelve men two by two to the place prepared for them, during which time the schola or the clergy begin to sing or recite the antiphons, psalms and verses indicated below.

When the washing of the feet is nearly ended,the 8th antiphon _Ubi cáritas_ with its verses is begun. If necessary, some of the preceding antiphons may be omitted, but never this antiphon _Ubi cáritas_.

> The Antiphons are each repeated after the Psalm or Versicle. Only the first verse of the Psalm is said in each case.

*) Pages as in _Liber Usualis_.

After the feet-washing, the celebrant says _Pater noster_ in silence, followed up by _Dóminus vobiscum_ and a prayer. The Mass is continued in the usual way.

## From the Offertory to the End

**Offer:** _Dextera Dómini_ (p. 677), **Comm:** _Dominus Jésus_ (p. 679) \[[Download](/pdf/maundy-thursday-part-3.pdf)\]

Preface, Sanctus and Benedictus as usual. The preface of the holy Cross is said.

> At the _Agnus Dei_, the response each time is: **miserére nobis**.

> The kiss of peace is omitted, as well as the first of the three prayers: _Dómine Jesu Christe, qui dixísti_. The _Confiteor_ and absolution also are omitted.

After the Holy Communion, Mass is continued in the usual way, but the celebrant genuflects each time he goes to or from the middle of the altar or crosses in front of the Blessed Sacrament. When he says _Dóminus vobiscum_ he turns to the people not from the middle but from the Gospel side, to avoid turning his back on the Blessed Sacrament.

> Instead of _Ite missa est_, we sing [Benedicámus Dómino](/pdf/benedicamus-II.pdf) (p. 22).

## The Solemn Translation and Reservation of the Blessed Sacrament

Immediately after the Mass, there takes place the solemn translation and reservation of the Blessed Sacrament, which is kept in a ciborium for Holy Communion the next day.

During the procession the hymn [Pánge, língua](/pdf/pange-lingua.pdf) (p. 957) is sung until the verse _Tantum ergo_ <u>exclusive</u>; if necessary, the hymn is repeated from the second verse.

When the altar of Repose is reached, the celebrant (helped by the deacon if necessary) puts down the ciborium on the altar. He then kneels, puts incense in the thurible and censes the Blessed Sacrament: meanwhile the **Tantum ergo** is sung.

After a short adoration in silence we return to the church where the _stripping of the altars_ will take place.

## The Stripping of the Altars

The celebrant says the following antiphon in a clear voice:

(Psalm 21, 19): _Divisérunt sibi vestiménta mea: et super vestem meam misérunt sortem._

Adding the intonation of the same psalm: _(1) Deus, Deus meus, réspice in me: quare me dereliquísti?_ (p. 749, [download](/pdf/psalm-21.pdf))

The chorus continues the recitation of this psalm until the stripping of the altars is completed.

After stripping the altars they return to the high altar, and when the celebrant has repeated the antiphon _Divisérunt_, they return to the sacristy.
