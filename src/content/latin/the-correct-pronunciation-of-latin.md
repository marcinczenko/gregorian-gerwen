## The Correct Pronunciation of Latin According to Roman Usage

Already in the [Liber Usualis](/pdf/latin-pronunciation-liber-usualis.pdf) we can find enough hints of the intended pronunciation of Latin in the Gregorian Singing. Yet, the diversity of the local customs and historical context resulted in a number different latin pronunciations: the German (in countries like Germany, but also in Poland) and Italian being the two most widely used today. The _ecclesiastical_ or the _church_ latin, being an Italian dialect, is currently the most widely used in the Catholic Church liturgy. We also know about the _classical_ Latin pronunciation that for long has been declared as highly uncertain, but more recent research (to do: reference) indicates that the classical pronunciation might have been the closest to the one actually used in the Catholic Church throughout the ages.

There is very little declarative work from the Holy See with clear intention of normalizing of the Latin pronunciation at least in the public liturgy, especially in singing. The most authoritative work on the subject seems to be [The Correct Pronunciation of Latin According to Roman Usage](/pdf/correct-pronunciation-of-latin.pdf).

In particular, especially in Benelux, the attention should be stressed on the correct pronunciation of the double vowels _EU_, as in _Deus_, _meus_, _meum_. As indicated on page 10 of the above mentioned document:

>  These vowels generally form one syllable but both are distinctly heard.

Also, on page 14, we find example of how to properly pronounce the word _Deus_, being _DEH-oos_ - thus, both _e_ (pronounced _EH_) en _u_ (pronounced _oo_) are distinctly heard. In particular one should clearly stress that pronunciation of _Deus_ as _DEH-eeyoos_ is **incorrect** regardless of the latin dialect being exercised locally. Clearly it is **Deus** not _Dejus_ in the end (as would be the case for _ejus_, pronounced _EH-eeyoos_). **Meus**, not _mejus_, but also **mea**, not _meja_. (see also page 16 of the quoted document, showing the correct pronunciation of consonant _J_).

[Liber Usualis](/pdf/latin-pronunciation-liber-usualis.pdf) confirms the above notes, reminding that:

> Each vowel has one sound; a mixture or sequence of sounds would be fatal to good Latin pronunciation; this is far more important than their exact length.

Moreover on page _xxxvii_ we find that:

> **U** is pronounced as _oo_ in _Moon_, never as _u_ in _custom_.

As said in Liber Usualis: _The correct pronunciation of Latin words, vowels and consonants is a rock of offense to many people._

Thus, difference in dialects (e.g. German vs Italian, or even far less common Classic) is far less offensive than evident errors or mixing of various dialects. Being consistent and correct within given dialect is way better than being _consistently incorrect_.
