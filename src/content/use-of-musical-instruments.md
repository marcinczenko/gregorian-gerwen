## Times when the use of musical instruments is forbidden

> Instruction of the S. Congregation of Rites, 3 Sept. 1958, concerning sacred music and the liturgy, chap. 3, n° 4, F.).

1. Since organ music, and still more that of other instruments, constitutes an _adornment_ of the liturgy, the use of these instruments must accord with the degree of rejoicing that belongs to each day and to each liturgical season.
2. Consequently, the music of the organ, and every other musical instrument, is forbidden in all liturgical actions, except Benediction of the B. Sacrament:

    a) During the season of Advent; that is from I Vespers of the I Sunday of Advent until None of Christmas Eve.

    b) During Lent and Passiontide; that is, from Matins of Ash Wednesday until _Glória in excélsis_ of the Mass of the Easter Vigil.

    c) On the Ember ferias and Saturday of September, if their Office and Mass are being said.

    d) At the whole Office and Masses of the Dead.
  
3. Further, the music of instruments other than the organ is forbidden on Septuagesima, Sexagesima and Quinquagesima Sundays and the ferias that follow them.
4. There are the following exceptions to the above prohibitions:
    
    a) The music of the organ and other instruments is allowed on feasts of obligation and holidays (except Sundays), as well as on the feast of the principal patron of the place, of the titular or dedication anniversary of the particular church, or of the founder of the religious congregation; or if some extraordinary solemnity is being kept.

    b) The music of the organ only, or the harmonium, is allowed on the III Sunday of Advent and the IV Sunday of Lent; and on Maundy Thursday at the Mass of the Holy Oils, and from the beginning of the evening Mass _in cena Domini_ until the end of _Glória in excélsis_.

    c) The music of the organ or harmonium is also allowed at Mass and Vespers solely to support the singing.

    The local Ordinaries can regulate the details of these prohibitions or permissions, having regard to approved customs of the place or country.

5. During the whole _Triduum sacrum_, that is, from midnight preceding Maundy Thursday until _Glória in excélsis Déo_ of the Easter Vigil, the organ and harmonium must remain absolutely silent; they must not even be used to support the singing; apart from the exceptions given above, 4 _b)_.


    The music of organ and harmonium is equally forbidden during the _Triduum sacrum_, with no exception and not withstanding any contrary custom, in any devotional exercises.

6. Parish priests, and others whom it concerns, should not fail fully to explain to the people the reason for this liturgical silence.
